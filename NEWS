* added soft (optional) dependencies on backend libraries. Exception with useful information will be
  raised when functionality that depends on missing package is used. Example: "Exception: Optional
  package 'sqlalchemy' is not installed. Please install the package from http://www.sqlalchemy.org/ to
  be able to use: SQL streams. Recommended version is > 0.7"
