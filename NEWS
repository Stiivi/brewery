* none so far

Fixes

* none so far

Version 0.8
===========

News
----

* Changed license to MIT
* Created new brewery runner commands: 'run' and 'graph':
    * 'brewery run stream.json' will execute the stream
    * 'brewery graph stream.json' will generate graphviz data
* Nodes: Added pretty printer node - textual output as a formatted table
* Nodes: Added source node for a generator function
* Nodes: added analytical type to derive field node
* Preliminary implementation of data probes (just concept, API not decided yet
  for 100%)
* CSV: added empty_as_null option to read empty strings as Null values
* Nodes can be configured with node.configure(dictionary, protected). If 
  'protected' is True, then protected attributes (specified in node info) can 
  not be set with this method.

* added node identifier to the node reference doc
* added create_logger

* added experimental retype feature (works for CSV only at the moment)
* Mongo Backend - better handling of record iteration

Changes
-------

* CSV: resource is now explicitly named argument in CSV*Node
* CSV: convert fields according to field storage type (instead of all-strings)
* Removed fields getter/setter (now implementation is totally up to stream
  subclass)
* AggregateNode: rename "aggregates" to "measures", added "measures" as public
  node attribute
* moved errors to brewery.common
* removed "field_name()", now str(field) should be used
* use named blogger 'brewery' instead of the global one
* better debug-log labels for nodes (node type identifier + python object ID)

WARNING: Compatibility break (with deprecation warning):

* depreciate __node_info__ and use plain node_info instead
* Stream.update() now takes nodes and connections as two separate arguments

Fixes
-----

* added SQLSourceNode, added option to keep ifelds instead of dropping them in 
  FieldMap and FieldMapNode (patch by laurentvasseur @ bitbucket)
* better traceback handling on node failure (now actually the traceback is
  displayed)
* return list of field names as string representation of FieldList
* CSV: fixed output of zero numeric value in CSV (was empty string)

Version 0.7
===========

WARNING: basic API incompatibility introduced

* added soft (optional) dependencies on backend libraries. Exception with
  useful information will be raised when functionality that depends on missing
  package is used. Example: "Exception: Optional package 'sqlalchemy' is not
  installed. Please install the package from http://www.sqlalchemy.org/ to be
  able to use: SQL streams. Recommended version is > 0.7"
* field related classes and functions were moved from 'ds' module to
  'metadata' and included in brewery top-level: Field, FieldList,
  expand_record, collapse_record

* Lots of documentation additions and changes
* Added list of optional package requirements into documentation

Depreciated functions
---------------------
* brewery.ds.field_name() - use str(field) instead
* brewery.ds.fieldlist() - use brewery.metadata.FieldList() instead

Streams
-------
* new node: DeriveNode - derive new field with callables or string formula
  (python expression)
* new SelectNode implementation: accepts callables or string with python code
* former SelectNode renamed to FunctionSelectNode
