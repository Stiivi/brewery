Brewery is a framework for data analysis and data quality measurement. The framework uses streams of
structured data that flow between processing nodes.

The framework consists of several modules:

* *metadata* – field types and field type operations, describe structure of data (available directly
  from the `brewery` package namespace)
* *ds* – structured data streams data sources and data targets
* *streams* – data processing streams
* *nodes* – analytical and processing stream nodes
* *probes* – analytical and quality data probes
