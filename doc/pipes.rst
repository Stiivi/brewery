Data Pipes and Data Processing Streams
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Data processing stream is a network of data processing nodes connected by data pipes. There are
several data processing node types:

* *source nodes* - provide data from data sources such as CSV files or database tables
* *target nodes* - nodes for consuming data and storing them or creating data visualisations
* *record nodes* - perform operations on whole records, such as merging, joining, aggregations
* *field nodes* - perform operations on particuliar fields, such as text substitution, field
  renaming, deriving new fields, restructuring
